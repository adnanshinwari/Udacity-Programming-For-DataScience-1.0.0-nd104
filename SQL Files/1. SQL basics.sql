Summary:
Statement:			How To Use It						Other Description
SELECT				SELECT Col1, Col2, â€¦				Provide the columns you want
FROM				FROM Table							Provide the table where the columns exist
LIMIT				LIMIT **10 **						Limits based number of rows returned
ORDER BY			ORDER BY Col						Orders table based on the column. Used with DESC.
WHERE				WHERE Col > 5						A conditional statement to filter your results
LIKE				WHERE Col LIKE '%me%'				Only pulls rows where column has 'me' within the text
IN					WHERE Col IN ('Y', 'N')				A filter for only rows with column of 'Y' or 'N'
NOT					WHERE Col NOT IN ('Y', 'N')			NOT is frequently used with LIKE and IN
AND					WHERE **Col1 > 5 AND Col2 < 3** 	Filter rows where two or more conditions must be true
OR					WHERE Col1 > 5 OR Col2 < 3			Filter rows where at least one condition must be true
BETWEEN				WHERE Col BETWEEN 3 AND 5			Often easier syntax than using an AND

Query 1:
All of the orders for each account_id are grouped together, &
then within each of those groupings, the orders appear from the
greatest order amount to the least.

Query 2:
Since you sorted by the total_amt_usd first, the orders appear from
greatest to least regardless of which account_id they were from.
Then they are sorted by account_id next.(The secondary sorting by
account_id is difficult to see here, since only if there were two
orders with equal total_amt_usd would there need to be any sorting
by account_id)
